Implement settings: 
	* Create subdirectory for playlists.
	* Remove downloaded items from list.

Code refactoring:
	* Avoid magic strings: 
		There are a few occurrences of string literals that could be replaced with constants or variables with meaningful names. 
		For example, the string "Highest Resolution" 
		could be replaced with a constant 
		or enum to improve readability and maintainability.
