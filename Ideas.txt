Implement settings: 
	* Remove downloaded items from list.
	(Forgot to implement the actual code for it.)


* Better use experience:
	- Modify the loading.
	- Have the last saved media to be on top and not at the bottom.

	- Have the user be able to update the data.
	- Have the user be able to delete the data.
	- Have the user be able to select saved videos/playlist/channels to delete them or update their data.
